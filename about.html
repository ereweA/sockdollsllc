    Bringing Comfort and Joy, One Sock Doll at a Time
    At Playmate Sock Dolls, LLC, we believe that every child deserves a reason to smile, especially those spending time in hospitals. Founded in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, we’re a small business with a big heart, dedicated to crafting handmade sock dolls and puppets that offer comfort, companionship, and cheer to children in pediatric care.
    What sets us apart is more than just our products—it’s our people. Our company proudly employs a team made up largely of individuals with disabilities, providing meaningful employment in an inclusive, empowering environment. Every doll we make is a symbol of compassion, care, and craftsmanship.
    Our journey started with co-founders Susan York and Tiffany Brown, two nurses who saw firsthand the power of a soft, friendly face in a hospital room. What began as a small outreach to hospitals in Wisconsin and Minnesota has grown into a mission-driven business committed to making a difference.
    Now, as we expand into the world of e-commerce, our goal remains the same: to connect children’s hospitals with high-quality, handmade dolls that brighten days and offer a comforting touch during difficult times.
    We invite you to be a part of our story, whether you're a hospital representative, a supporter of inclusive employment, or someone who believes in the power of a simple, heartfelt gift.
    Thank you for supporting Playmate Sock Dolls, where every stitch is made with love.
